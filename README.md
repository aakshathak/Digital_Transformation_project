Comment on the PDF document retrieval.

We integrated our task, specifically for PDF retrieval, with the primary functionality developed by Guja. This involved the creation of two new files, namely gpt_endpoint_with_pdf.py and document_processing.py. Additionally, we made modifications to the main.py file by adding two lines of code and included one line in the existing requirement.txt file, which was initially authored by Guja.

However, we encountered an error during execution

from pypdf2 import PdfReader
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pypdf2'
